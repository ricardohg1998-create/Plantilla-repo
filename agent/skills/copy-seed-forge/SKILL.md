description: Replace generic copy and dead UIs with domain microcopy and realistic seeded datasets.

# Copy + Seed Forge

## Goal
Eliminate AI-ish copy and enforce domain realism with seeded data.

## When to use
- Copy is generic.
- UI lacks realistic data.

## Minimal inputs (ask only if missing)
- Entities + statuses.
- Tone constraints.

## Procedure (MUST)
1) Identify entities and states.
2) Write microcopy per screen.
3) Seed dataset (20–60 rows) with realistic distributions.
4) Validate layout under edge values.

## Outputs (MUST produce)
- `docs/microcopy.md`.
- Seed dataset + import notes.
