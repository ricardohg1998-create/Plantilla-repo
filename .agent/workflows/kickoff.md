description: Kick off PRODUCTION-depth delivery; plan + architecture decision + IA/flows + design system + signature patterns.
---

1. Initialize docs from templates
   Copy templates into `docs/` and fill `docs/implementation_plan.md` + `docs/design_concept.md`.

2. Choose stack intentionally
   Run `stack-architect-selector` and create `docs/architecture_decision.md`.

3. Prevent shallow outcomes
   Run `product-depth-expander` to produce IA + flows + branch sets including first vertical slice.

4. Establish authored UI
   Run `design-system-forge` then `signature-patterns-lab`. Fill `docs/ui_audit.md` if a kit is used.
