# Design QA + Polish Pass

## Do not use when
- The request is unrelated to this domain or requires a different specialized skill.
- The user asks only for high-level discussion without applying this workflow.
- Another skill has a tighter, more specific trigger for the same request.

## Example user requests
- "Apply design qa polish pass to improve this feature."
- "Use design qa polish pass and give me the concrete deliverables."
- "Can you run a full design qa polish pass pass on this repo?"
- "I need step-by-step execution using design qa polish pass."
## Goal
Remove the remaining “AI smell”: subtle inconsistencies, kit artifacts, unfinished states, and copy roughness.

## When to use
- Before final delivery.
- After major UI changes.

## Minimal inputs (ask only if missing)
- Key routes.
- Target devices.

## Procedure (MUST)
1) Audit rhythm/alignment and typography scale.
2) Audit states (empty/loading/error/success) and disabled/focus.
3) Remove kit fingerprints.
4) Improve interaction feedback.
5) Produce punchlist and apply fixes; capture proof.

## Outputs (MUST produce)
- `docs/design_qa.md` with punchlist + fixes.
- Applied polish changes.
