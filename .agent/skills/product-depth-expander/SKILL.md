description: Use when the request requires expand vague requirements into PRODUCTION-depth IA, flows, branch sets, and cross-cutting requirements.

# Product Depth Expander

## Do not use when
- The request is unrelated to this domain or requires a different specialized skill.
- The user asks only for high-level discussion without applying this workflow.
- Another skill has a tighter, more specific trigger for the same request.

## Example user requests
- "Apply product depth expander to improve this feature."
- "Use product depth expander and give me the concrete deliverables."
- "Can you run a full product depth expander pass on this repo?"
- "I need step-by-step execution using product depth expander."
## Goal
Convert ambiguity into a senior-grade plan: IA, flows, branching, and transversal requirements.

## When to use
- Request is vague.
- Risk of shallow landing output.

## Minimal inputs (ask only if missing)
- Domain + users + primary JTBD.
- Project class + depth profile.

## Procedure (MUST)
1) Enforce Depth Gate.
2) Produce navigation map + top 3 flows.
3) Enumerate branch set for each flow.
4) Add transversal requirements.
5) Define first vertical slice with persistence/integration.

## Outputs (MUST produce)
- Updated implementation plan with IA/flows/branches.
- Phased backlog and DoD evidence plan.
