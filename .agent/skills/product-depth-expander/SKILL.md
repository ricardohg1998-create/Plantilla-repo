# Product Depth Expander

## Goal
Convert ambiguity into a senior-grade plan: IA, flows, branching, and transversal requirements.

## When to use
- Request is vague.
- Risk of shallow landing output.

## Minimal inputs (ask only if missing)
- Domain + users + primary JTBD.
- Project class + depth profile.

## Procedure (MUST)
1) Enforce Depth Gate.
2) Produce navigation map + top 3 flows.
3) Enumerate branch set for each flow.
4) Add transversal requirements.
5) Define first vertical slice with persistence/integration.

## Outputs (MUST produce)
- Updated implementation plan with IA/flows/branches.
- Phased backlog and DoD evidence plan.
