# Onboarding + Activation Designer

## Do not use when
- The request is unrelated to this domain or requires a different specialized skill.

- "Use onboarding activation designer and give me the concrete deliverables."

## Procedure (MUST)

2) Guided empty states + quick start.
3) Progressive disclosure.
4) Confirmation + next-step prompts.
5) Instrument key steps (no PII).
