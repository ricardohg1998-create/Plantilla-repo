# Signature Patterns Lab

## Do not use when
- The request is unrelated to this domain or requires a different specialized skill.
- The user asks only for high-level discussion without applying this workflow.
- Another skill has a tighter, more specific trigger for the same request.

## Example user requests
- "Apply signature patterns lab to improve this feature."
- "Use signature patterns lab and give me the concrete deliverables."
- "Can you run a full signature patterns lab pass on this repo?"
- "I need step-by-step execution using signature patterns lab."
## Goal
Implement repeatable signature patterns (navigation/surface/data) that create a unique identity without harming usability/perf.

## When to use
- UI feels generic.
- Before scaling screens.

## Minimal inputs (ask only if missing)
- Primary flows.
- Brand cues or inferred metaphor.

## Procedure (MUST)
1) Ensure design concept exists.
2) Propose 3 candidate patterns.
3) Select 2–3 repeatable patterns.
4) Implement as reusable components/variants.
5) Apply across screens and capture proof.

## Outputs (MUST produce)
- Updated design concept placement rules.
- Reusable pattern implementations.
- Proof references in walkthrough.
