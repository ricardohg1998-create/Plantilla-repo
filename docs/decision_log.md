## Decisions
- **Decision:** 
  - **Context:** 
  - **Options considered:** 
  - **Why chosen:** 
  - **Tradeoffs:** 
  - **Follow-ups:** 
- **Decision:** Add a mandatory "Definition of Done" validation checklist to the Skill Creator guidance.
  - **Context:** The Skill Creator workflow needed an explicit pre-delivery quality gate for newly created or updated skills.
  - **Options considered:** (1) Keep checklist guidance distributed across existing sections, (2) Add a dedicated final checklist section.
  - **Why chosen:** A dedicated end-of-flow checklist is easier to apply consistently before delivery.
  - **Tradeoffs:** Slightly longer SKILL.md, but lower risk of missing key quality requirements.
  - **Follow-ups:** Keep the checklist aligned with validator expectations if packaging checks evolve.
