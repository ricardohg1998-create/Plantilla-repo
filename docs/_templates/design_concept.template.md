# Design Concept (Thesis)

## Brand narrative & visual metaphor

Use this section to articulate the overarching story and metaphor that will bind the entire experience together. A strong narrative goes beyond superficial aesthetics: it should reflect the client's mission, values and promise in a way that resonates with visitors. Describe the metaphor (e.g., a journey, a workshop, a growing ecosystem) and explain how it will inform layout, imagery and interactions.

## Competitive & inspiration research

- Summarise insights from at least three competitor or industry reference sites. What works well? What feels overused or generic?
- Note any emerging design or technology trends (animations, layouts, typography) that could inspire your project.
- Capture what you want to avoid so the final product stands apart.

## System grammar

- **Typography:** Select fonts that embody the brand personality and specify the scale (sizes, weights, line heights) to ensure consistency. Mention any custom type treatments or ligatures.
- **Colour & contrast:** Define a palette with at least one accent colour and provide guidance for light and dark variants. Explain how colours communicate mood and hierarchy.
- **Density & spacing rhythm:** Set rules for spacing between elements, component padding and overall layout density. Reference grid or spacing units you plan to use.
- **Iconography & illustration:** Outline the style direction (outline vs filled, geometric vs organic) and note whether custom illustrations or icon sets will be created.
- **Motion semantics:** Define micro‑interactions (e.g., hover, click, page transitions) using clear parameters (duration, easing/spring stiffness). Specify where motion should draw attention and where it should stay subtle.

## Signature patterns (2–3)

Describe two or three unique interactive or visual patterns that will distinguish this project from generic templates. Each pattern should be tied to the narrative and deliver value beyond decoration.

1. **Pattern #1 – description:** Identify a distinctive component or experience (for example, a parallax storytelling section, a dynamic data visualisation or an interactive product configurator). Explain its purpose and how it supports the narrative.
2. **Pattern #2 – description:** A second pattern (such as scroll‑triggered storytelling, timeline animation, or interactive map) with rationale.
3. **Pattern #3 – description (optional):** If a third pattern is needed, describe it here.

For each pattern, provide:
- **Placement rules:** Where the pattern should appear and how often. Avoid overuse that could reduce impact.
- **Technical notes:** Libraries or frameworks required, performance considerations and fallback states for reduced motion or unsupported browsers.

## Content & depth strategy

- **Narrative flow:** Outline how pages will go beyond a single hero and three cards. Describe the sequence of sections and how they build a story that guides users towards key actions.
- **Meaningful interactions:** Define at least one interactive element that engages users (e.g., a form with validation, an interactive calculator, an interactive gallery with filtering, or an animated timeline). Include considerations for error and success states.
- **Real copy & data:** Plan for authentic microcopy (avoid lorem ipsum) and semi‑realistic seeded data (names, dates, values). Identify tone of voice and vocabulary.
- **State definitions:** List expected loading, empty, error and success states for key components.

## Token taxonomy

Provide a list of design tokens that will drive consistency across the site:

- **Core tokens:** Base colours, typographic scales, spacing units, radii, elevation/shadow values.
- **Semantic tokens:** Contextual colours (success, warning, info), emphasis styles and any domain‑specific tokens.

## Placement rules

Detail rules that govern composition:

- How spacing units translate to margins and padding across breakpoints.
- Column widths and layout grids used for alignment.
- How signature patterns integrate within the overall layout without compromising readability or accessibility.
